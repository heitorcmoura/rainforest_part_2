Welcome to Rainforest.

Youâ€™ve made an app similar to Imgur we called Photogur, now we are going to make another one and dive deeper into Rails concepts. This app is going to be a clone of Amazon, the famous e-commerce application. It's going to let users create their own products and allow other users to review them.

The following concepts are covered in this application:

* Migrations
* Partials
* Respond to JSON
* Associations
* Validations (already covered briefly)
* Validation errors
* Writing methods in your model
* User Authentication with BCrypt
* Sessions and cookies
* Alerts / notices
* Helper methods
* Associations
  * belongs to
  * has many
* Nested resources
* Before filters
* Authorization
* Testing a rails app (RSpec) *time pending

Have fun!
